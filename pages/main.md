# Hi there!

My name is Dimitrije[^1]. I'm a backend engineer.

I have 11 years of professional experience in designing, building, deploying
and maintaining backend services. I currently work at Jane Street as Linux
Engineer. I've previously worked as SRE at Google. If you want to learn more,
check out my [CV](/cv).

I like video and board games, science fiction and my beloved Shih Tzu
Mochiko.
