Hi, I'm a backend engineer with more than 8 years of experience in the
industry. Check out my CV at 
I am a software engineer who values simplicity and elegance above all else, in all things. My current field of interest is backend system architecture and development.

My goal is to design and write highly concurrent, performant services, resilient to failure, that easily scale, communicate with other services in a simple manner and, as such, represent a part of a well designed architecture.

I am seasoned in Java. My strong set of skills includes developing OLTP applications using RDBMs (PostgreSQL preferred) and/or NoSQL data stores (Redis/Riak), writing network stacks from scratch or relying on existing libraries (Netty), and pinpointing bottlenecks and performance issues in these kinds of apps, where I rely on my proficiency with monitoring tools. My secondary skill set covers C#/.NET and Unity3D, and C/C++.

I only feel at home while working in a Unix environment, and terminal is my #1 indispensable tool. I enjoy doing fast and dirty scripting (bash/Python) to create reusable tools for repetitive, boring stuff, and I have some experience in system administration.

Throwing in some fields of interest: functional programming (Clojure), concurrency models (threads, actors, STM), IPC (Unix sockets/message queues), distributed computing, numerical simulations, FLOSS philosophy and open standards.

My hobbies include having fun with RPi and some simple Arduino electronics (remote temperature and AC/DC sensing), hard science fiction, astrophysics, and all kinds of video and board games.

I dream of creating a space-themed MMORPG one day.
