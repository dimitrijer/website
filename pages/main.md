# Hi there!

My name is Dimitrije[^1], and I'm a backend engineer.

I have 10 years of professional experience of designing, building, deploying
and maintaining backend services. I currently work at Google as an SRE. If you
want to learn more, check out my [CV](/cv).

I like video and board games, science fiction and my beloved Shih Tzu
Mochiko.
