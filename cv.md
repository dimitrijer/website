# Curriculum Vitae

_(this page is also available for [download in PDF form](/files/cv.pdf))_

I am a software engineer with more than eight years of professional experience
in backend architecture and development, video game development, infrastructure
and DevOps, machine learning engineering, and, most recently, Site
Reliability Engineering.

My diverse background provides me with deep knowledge of computer systems, from
low-level hardware intricacies to high-level software abstractions, and from
user-facing websites and apps to number-crunching processes tirelessly working
behind the scenes. This, along with the ability to quickly learn new key
concepts and effectively map them to what I know, gives me unique versatility.
Over the years I have come to appreciate this as my biggest strength.

I enjoy designing and developing distributed, fault-tolerant and highly
concurrent architectures. My passion is to find concise, elegant, maintainable
and performant solutions, and build them with the right tools for the job. I
have a lot of those under my belt, having worked with multitude of well-known
and widely used technologies.

With a knack for explaining and teaching, and a big pool of patience and
understanding, I love sharing my knowledge and helping out. At the same time, I
communicate clearly and efficiently, and thrive in challenging environments
where I, too, can learn and grow. I am sensitive, compassionate and warm to
others, with a strong sense of justice and fair play. All of the above makes me
a pretty good team player.

My hobbies include playing video and board games, reading science fiction and
fantasy, toying with SoC boards, riding my bike - and doing all of this in the
wonderful company of my Shih-Tzu Mochi.
 
# Experiences

- January 2020 - present: _Systems Engineer, SRE_, [Google](https://about.google.com)

- March 2018 - October 2020: *Machine Learning Engineer*, [Nordeus](https://nordeus.com)

    * Part of ML/AI team with the mission of using bleeding edge machine
      learning algorithms for building unique and novel features in our games.
    * I was responsible for integrating proof-of-concept and prototype projects
      developed within the team with actual production infrastructure, while
      maintaining required level of performance and quality.
    * Also tasked with establishing and maintaining good engineering practices,
      without considerably hindering velocity of the research part of the team.
    * Designed, built, configured and maintained a machine-learning pipeline,
      which included data mining, multi-stage preprocessing, human-in-the-loop
      review process integration, feeding reviewed data to a machine learning
      algorithm, and automating testing and algorithm performance evaluation
      with regards to code changes.
    * Administered GPU cluster used for training and inference.
    * Applied classical AI algorithms, such as behaviour trees and utility
      functions, and reinforcement learning to develop several iterations of AI
      bots for [Heroic: Magic Duel](https://www.heroicgame.com/).

- February 2012 - March 2018: *Software Development Engineer*, [Nordeus](https://nordeus.com)

    * Worked as a video game developer on four different game projects,
      including Nordeus' most successful game, [Top
      Eleven](https://www.topeleven.com/).
    * Supported development of various game features on both backend and
      frontend side.
    * Designed and developed distributed login service that at its peak had ~7
      million unique daily logins.
    * Was a part of the effort to convert a legacy, monolithic backend service
      to microservice architecture.
    * Designed and built a proxy that allowed WebSocket frontends to
      communicate with backend services in proprietary binary protocol. This
      service eventually became the edge service for all clients.
    * Introduced several significant concepts to backend teams over the years,
      including key-value stores, message queues, observability in terms of
      ubiquitous metrics and distributed tracing, modern build tools and CI/CD
      pipeline, continuous code quality and code health metrics and centralized
      linting.
      
- October 2009 - May 2014: *Junior Teaching Assistant*, Seminar of Astronomy,
  [Petnica Science Center](http://petnica.rs)

    * Taught basics of programming to high-school students at the seminar, i.e.
      introduction to programming with C and Python, version control, working
      in terminal, writing data mining scrapers etc. Petnica Science
      Center is an independent and nonprofit organization for
      extracurricular, formal and informal science education.

# Tech Skills

- Programming languages, in order of proficiency:
  * __Java__ - full professional proficiency, and my language of choice. I did
    most of my backend development in Java.
  * __C#__ - full professional proficiency. Most of my experience with C# comes
    from scripting in Unity game engine.
  * __Python__ - full professional proficiency. My favorite quick and dirty
    scripting language. Used it for developing small backend services, command
    line tools, machine learning and rapid GUI development.
  * __Clojure__ - high proficiency.
  * __C/C++__ - high proficiency.
  * Haskell, Go - basic proficiency.
- Versatile and under-the-hood knowledge of UNIX systems, especially GNU/Linux:
  usage, configuration and administration.
- Shell scripting, and broad knowledge of a plethora of command line utilities
  for manipulating and transforming data.
- Networking: understanding of L3/L4 protocols like TCP/IP and UDP, and higher
  level protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, WebSockets, QUIC, DNS etc.
  Knowledge of low-level networking facilities like sockets, blocking and
  non-blocking syscalls (`select` and `epoll`), experience with well-known and
  widely used networking libraries, such as Netty, Jetty, requests, Flask,
  ring, compojure and zeromq, and debugging tools like `ss`, `netcat`, `iperf`,
  `tcpdump`, Wireshark etc. Some knowledge of network stack and its
  optimization on Linux systems.
- Multithreading primitives like mutexes, semaphores, locks, conditions, and
  high-level abstractions such as futures, promises, coroutines and async
  programming.
- IPC mechanisms such as pipes, shared memory, UNIX sockets and the MPI
  library.
- Databases:
  * __PostgreSQL__ - full professional proficiency. Thorough understanding of
    MVCC, locking, indexing, views, triggers, partitioning, stored procedures,
    as well as Postgres specific features: `plpgsql`, foreign data wrappers,
    materialized views, statistics tables (`pg_*`), advisory locks, access
    control, replication, backup, configuration, document data types, full text
    search support, functional indexes, GIN indexes etc. My database of choice,
    and one I used the most.
  * __SQLite__ - high proficiency. My favorite embeddable database. If querying
    data is any more complex than performing a dictionary lookup, this is what
    I use.
  * __Redis__ - high proficiency, used for things such as game leaderboards and
    caching.
  * Aerospike, CouchDB, Cassandra, MongoDB, memcached - basic proficiency.
