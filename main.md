# Hi there!

My name is Dimitrije[^1], and I'm a backend engineer.

I have 8 years of professional experience of designing, developing, deploying
and maintaining backend services. I'm currently working at Google as a Systems
Engineer, SRE.

I write code in Java and Python, and in my own time I use Clojure and learn
Haskell. I like video and board games, science fiction and my beloved Shih Tzu
Mochiko.
